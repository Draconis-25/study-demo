# What is this wonder?

Well, even though this looks pretty hard to achieve, thanks to the fellas at Rust Foundation, we've got this tool
called [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/), which does all the heavy lifting for us(No Murathan not that kind of lifting).

You just install the tool, call it with 

```
mdbook init project-name
```
and it creates everything that you'll need. Then you will write your texts in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)
(It's extremely easy, don't worry, everything you gotta learn is about 10 lines or smth), add it to the index and well, nothing happens.
You need a waiter to get food right?

```
mdbook serve
```
With this command you'll see the website, updated everytime you hit ctrl+s automatically. Just try it and you will see an
industry leading website at your fingertips. Aight maybe not that goog but everything is better than a pdf. Yes, Aselmun study
guide I'm talking about you.
